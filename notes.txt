Good Morning, doctor. May I come in? Good Morning. What is your name?I am 20.How are you? You do look quite pale this morning.My name is Arushi.Yes, doctor. Iâ€™ve not been feeling well for the past few days. Iâ€™ve been having a stomach ache for a few days and feeling a bit dizzy since yesterday.Okay, let me check. Does it hurt here? Yes, doctor, the pain there is the sharpest.Well, you are suffering from a stomach infection, thatâ€™s the reason you are having a stomach ache and also getting dizzy. Did you change your diet recently or have something unhealthy?Actually, I went to a fair last week and ate food from the stalls there. Okay, so you are probably suffering from food poisoning. Since the food stalls in fairs are quite unhygienic, thereâ€™s a high chance those uncovered food might have caused food poisoning I think I will never eat from any unhygienic place in the future. I also have a family history of diabetes. Thatâ€™s good. Iâ€™m prescribing some medicines, have them for one week and come back for a checkup next week. And please try to avoid spicy and fried foods for now. Okay, doctor, thank you. Welcome.Hello doctor I have been very low my head

Good morning, I'm Dr. Mehta. What brings you in today?
Morning, Doctor. I've been having a dull pain in my lower abdomen for the past 4 days. It's been getting worse, especially after meals.
I see. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is the pain right now?
I'd say about a 6. Sometimes it spikes up to 8 in the evenings.
Does the pain radiate to any other part of your body?
Sometimes it moves to the right side near my back. It feels like a cramp.
Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits?
Yeah, I've felt a bit nauseous, and I vomited once yesterday morning. My stools have also been looser than usual.
Any fever or chills?
I had mild fever last night around 100.6F  and some chills before bed.
Have you taken any medications recently?
Just Paracetamol 500mg for the fever, once last night.
Do you have any history of digestive issues or surgeries?
I had appendicitis surgery around five years ago. Other than that, no major issues.
Are you allergic to any medications?
Yes, I'm allergic to Amoxicillin as I get rashes.
Got it. Have you been under a lot of stress lately, or changed your diet?
Not really. Though I did eat a lot of street food last weekend.
That could be a contributing factor. I'd like to run a few tests of blood panel, abdominal ultrasound, and maybe a stool culture. Meanwhile, I'll prescribe an antispasmodic and a probiotic. We'll avoid antibiotics for now due to your allergy.
Alright, thank you doctor.

Good morning, I'm Dr. Mehta. What brings you in today?
Morning, Doctor. I've been having a dull pain in my lower abdomen for the past 4 days. It's been getting worse, especially after meals.
I see. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is the pain right now?
I'd say about a 6. Sometimes it spikes up to 8 in the evenings.
Does the pain radiate to any other part of your body?
Sometimes it moves to the right side near my back. It feels like a cramp.
Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits?
Yeah, I've felt a bit nauseous, and I vomited once yesterday morning. My stools have also been looser than usual.
Any fever or chills?
I had mild fever last night around 100.6F  and some chills before bed.
Have you taken any medications recently?
Just Paracetamol 500mg for the fever, once last night.
Do you have any history of digestive issues or surgeries?
I had appendicitis surgery around five years ago. Other than that, no major issues.
Are you allergic to any medications?
Yes, I'm allergic to Amoxicillin as I get rashes.
Got it. Have you been under a lot of stress lately, or changed your diet?
Not really. Though I did eat a lot of street food last weekend.
That could be a contributing factor. I'd like to run a few tests of blood panel, abdominal ultrasound, and maybe a stool culture. Meanwhile, I'll prescribe an antispasmodic and a probiotic. We'll avoid antibiotics for now due to your allergy.
Alright, thank you doctor.

Good morning, I'm Dr. Mehta. What brings you in today?
Morning, Doctor. I've been having a dull pain in my lower abdomen for the past 4 days. It's been getting worse, especially after meals.
I see. On a scale of 1 to 10, how severe is the pain right now?
I'd say about a 6. Sometimes it spikes up to 8 in the evenings.
Does the pain radiate to any other part of your body?
Sometimes it moves to the right side near my back. It feels like a cramp.
Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits?
Yeah, I've felt a bit nauseous, and I vomited once yesterday morning. My stools have also been looser than usual.
Any fever or chills?
I had mild fever last night around 100.6F  and some chills before bed.
Have you taken any medications recently?
Just Paracetamol 500mg for the fever, once last night.
Do you have any history of digestive issues or surgeries?
I had appendicitis surgery around five years ago. Other than that, no major issues.
Are you allergic to any medications?
Yes, I'm allergic to Amoxicillin as I get rashes.
Got it. Have you been under a lot of stress lately, or changed your diet?
Not really. Though I did eat a lot of street food last weekend.
That could be a contributing factor. I'd like to run a few tests of blood panel, abdominal ultrasound, and maybe a stool culture. Meanwhile, I'll prescribe an antispasmodic and a probiotic. We'll avoid antibiotics for now due to your allergy.
Alright, thank you doctor.
